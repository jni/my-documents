### Author biography and LinkedIn profile: 

https://www.linkedin.com/in/jnuneziglesias

Neuroscience is my principal interest. I want to understand how neurons and
neuronal circuits perform computations and result in behavior. As a
researcher in computational biology (from a biochemistry background), I had
almost no formal training in programming. As such, during my PhD and part
of my postdoc, I committed all of the sins common in academic software:
more scripts than functions, no version control, no tests, and so on.

By the start of my postdoc I *was* making an effort to write good software.
I was lucky enough that my image segmentation library, Gala, was accepted
for a talk at the SciPy 2012 conference. That event changed my life and my
approach to software. St√©fan van der Walt, creator and lead developer of
the popular scikit-image library, invited me to participate in the sprint,
where I would make my first-ever GitHub pull request.

Today, I am a core developer for scikit-image, and (most) of my software
has at least *some* tests. I write regularly about good software
development practices on my blog, I Love Symposia. And I hope to set a good
example by mentoring younger students, for example as a mentor for the
Google Summer of Code '14.

### Why are you the best person to write this book?

I only recently ascended the software developer ladder from "lowly academic
hack" to "core dev of a major scientific library". As such, I understand
what it feels like to not know what "test-driven development", "continuous
integration", "cache misses", or even "NumPy array" mean. This places me in
a prime spot to guide new programmers through this.

I'm very passionate about teaching, and about good writing.

Finally, reviewing code for scikit-image pull requests, I've developed an
eye for what great code looks like. Some examples will be from those pull
requests, but the majority will come from polling developers from the
Scientific Python ecosystem, many of which I know personally from two SciPy
conferences, EuroSciPy 2013, and PyConAu 2014.

## Book Summary:

### In one sentence, tell us why the audience will want to buy your book.

Beginners will find it an entertaining way to learn about SciPy, while
masters will also be interested to see the great code that motivates each
chapter.

### Summarize what the book is about, like you would pitch it to a potential reader on the back cover.  What makes your book unique in the marketplace?

NumPy and SciPy form the core of the Scientific Python ecosystem. They also
have excellent online documentation, so a complete reference would be
pointless. Instead, we present the best code using these libraries,
using them as motivation to teach readers who have never used them before.

The examples will be chosen to highlight clever, elegant uses of advanced
features of NumPy, SciPy, and related libraries. The beginning reader will
learn not the functionality of the library, but its application to real
world problems using beautiful code. 

### Briefly explain the technology and why it is important.

## Audience:

### Explain who the primary audience is for your book. What skills can you assume they have mastered?

A reader should be familiar with the Python programming language. There should
be no other requirements to understand the book. The primary audience will be
novice-to-intermediate programmers who want to apply Python to a problem
requiring scientific libraries. For example, anyone who has recently taken a
Software Carpentry Python workshop would be interested in the book.

A secondary audience is the more advanced practitioners of scientific Python
programming, who might be interested in the advanced examples motivating each
lesson. After all, I fall into this category and the examples will be chosen
because I and similar programmers find them beautiful and insightful.

### Please estimate as best you can how many people will use this technology? Please state any applicable statistics (e.g., web searches, web site traffic, blogs) indicating market use or market growth.

I think O'Reilly is in a better place to answer this question, but regardless
of absolute numbers, they are certainly increasing dramatically. For example,
see this plot by Chris Beaumont, an astrophysicist at Harvard:

The SciPy conference has also grown dramatically over the past few years.

### Please provide some scenarios that indicate how the audience will use your book. For example, will readers refer to it daily as a reference? Will they read it once to learn the concepts and then refer to it occasionally?

This will not be a reference volume. As I mentioned, the internet now provides
a far better reference than any book could, especially considering the rapid
pace of development in this field. Instead, a reader will learn the core
concepts and capabilities of SciPy and related libraries by reading once, but
may well return for inspiration to the final code examples themselves.

## Key Topic Coverage:

### What problems does this book solve for its users?



### List the four or five topics covered or features included that will provide the greatest benefit to readers or will be the most likely to excite them? 

### Other Book Features and Video Offerings:
### Is there a companion web site? If so, what do you plan to include on the site? Would you be willing to participate in video offerings as well as workshops and training seminars?

Competition:
