    Neuroscience is my principal interest. I want to understand how neurons and
    neuronal circuits perform computations and result in behavior. As a
    researcher in computational biology (from a biochemistry background), I had
    almost no formal training in programming. As such, during my PhD and part
    of my postdoc, I committed all of the sins common in academic software:
    more scripts than functions, no version control, no tests, and so on.

    By the start of my postdoc I *was* making an effort to write good software.
    I was lucky enough that my image segmentation library, Gala, was accepted
    for a talk at the SciPy 2012 conference. That event changed my life and my
    approach to software. St√©fan van der Walt, creator and lead developer of
    the popular scikit-image library, invited me to participate in the sprint,
    where I would make my first-ever GitHub pull request.

    Today, I am a core developer for scikit-image, and (most) of my software
    has at least *some* tests. I write regularly about good software
    development practices on my blog, I Love Symposia. And I hope to set a good
    example by mentoring younger students, for example as a mentor for the
    Google Summer of Code '14.

## Why are you the best person to write this book?

    I only recently ascended the software developer ladder from "lowly academic
    hack" to "core dev of a major scientific library". As such, I understand
    what it feels like to not know what "test-driven development", "continuous
    integration", "cache misses", or even "NumPy array" mean. This places me in
    a prime spot to guide new programmers through this.

    I'm very passionate about teaching, and about good writing.

    Finally, reviewing code for scikit-image pull requests, I've developed an
    eye for what great code looks like. Some examples will be from those pull
    requests, but the majority will come from polling developers from the
    Scientific Python ecosystem, many of which I know personally from two SciPy
    conferences, EuroSciPy 2013, and PyConAu 2014.

# Book Summary:

## In one sentence, tell us why the audience will want to buy your book.

    Beginners will find it an entertaining way to learn about SciPy, while
    masters will also be interested to see the great code that motivates each
    chapter.

## Summarize what the book is about, like you would pitch it to a potential reader on the back cover.  What makes your book unique in the marketplace?

    NumPy and SciPy form the core of the Scientific Python ecosystem. They also
    have excellent online documentation, so a complete reference would be
    pointless. Instead, we present the best code using these libraries,
    using them as motivation to teach readers who have never used them before.

    The examples will be chosen to highlight clever, elegant uses of advanced
    features of NumPy, SciPy, and related libraries. The beginning reader will
    learn not the functionality of the library, but its application to real
    world problems using beautiful code. 

## Briefly explain the technology and why it is important.

Audience:
Explain who the primary audience is for your book. What skills can you assume they have mastered?


Please estimate as best you can how many people will use this technology? Please state any applicable statistics (e.g., web searches, web site traffic, blogs) indicating market use or market growth.


Please provide some scenarios that indicate how the audience will use your book. For example, will readers refer to it daily as a reference? Will they read it once to learn the concepts and then refer to it occasionally?

Key Topic Coverage:
What problems does this book solve for its users?

List the four or five topics covered or features included that will provide the greatest benefit to readers or will be the most likely to excite them? 

Other Book Features and Video Offerings:
Is there a companion web site? If so, what do you plan to include on the site? Would you be willing to participate in video offerings as well as workshops and training seminars?

Competition:
What books or online resources compete with this book? Please list the title and author. In each case, how will your book be different or better in timing, content, coverage, approach, or tone?
